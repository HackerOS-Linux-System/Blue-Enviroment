# ![Blue Enviroment - Graphical environment for HackerOS.](https://github.com/HackerOS-Linux-System/Blue-Enviroment/blob/main/images/banner.png)
## Blue Environment used in HackerOS - in the blue edition (in the future).
# About
Blue Environment is written primarily in C++ and Rust (the CLI tool that runs Blue Environment is in Crystal). Blue Environment tools are written in Vala and Python (e.g., settings). This graphical environment is a combination of a bit of plasma look, a bit of gnome and a bit of android (mainly the application menu) + my own vision.
